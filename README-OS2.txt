7. SUPPORT AND DONATIONS
========================

Tea is based on volunteer work. If you would like to support further
development, you can do so in one of the following ways:


  * Donate to the Qt5 project

  * While working on Qt 5 for OS/2, we are glad to know that our work is being partly sponsored by the grateful OS/2 community.
    Given the scale of this project and all other OS/2 projects that we work on, and also the fact that the OS/2 world has limited financial resources nowadays, every penny counts.
    We need to pay our full-time and part-time developers for their hard work. So any contribution is highly appreciated!
    To do so, please visit our online shop where you can buy development units of a preferred value.
    https://www.bitwiseworks.com/shop/index.php

  * Contribute to the project: Besides actual development, this also includes maintaining the documentation and the project web site as well as help for users.
